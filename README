Introduction
------------

Welcome to the VoxelGuest 4 (Bouncer) github repository! Yes, we are releasing VoxelGuest to the public and making it open source on Github. The project will be big, as it is a HUGE plugin. The original versions were much more aimed for exclusive use on The Voxel Box, but psanker wanted to make it a lot more modularized and abstracted to be quicker and cleaner.

If you wish to work on VG4, contact psanker on bukkit.org, thevoxelbox.com/forum/ or on irc.esper.net. He will tell you what you can do.

Notes about Indev builds: We request that you do not use these as they can be unstable.
